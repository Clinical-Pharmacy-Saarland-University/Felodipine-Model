# Felodipine-PBPK-Model
Parent-metabolite PBPK model of felodipine and its main metabolite dehydrofelodipine to be used as CYP3A4 victim drug in DDI simulations.

# Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body parent-metabolite PBPK model of felodipine and its metabolite dehydrofelodipine. The model was developed using a broad range of published clinical studies and its performance was evaluated within a DDI network with the perpetrator drugs itraconazole, erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitors) and carbamazepine/phenytoin (CYP3A4 inducers).
